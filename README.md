#CMA-CGM Port Codes JSON Dataset


Overview
This repository contains a JSON dataset of port codes as used by CMA-CGM, a leading worldwide shipping group. Unlike the standard global port codes, CMA-CGM uses its unique set of codes for operational purposes. This dataset has been converted from a publicly available PDF document provided by CMA-CGM and is now shared in a more accessible JSON format.

Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to provide developers, researchers, and logistics professionals with an easy-to-use JSON formatted dataset of CMA-CGM port codes. This dataset is particularly useful for those working in shipping, logistics, and supply chain management who require CMA-CGM's specific port codes for their applications and analyses.

Dataset Structure
The dataset is structured in JSON format, making it straightforward to integrate into web applications, data analysis tools, and other software. Each entry in the JSON file contains the port code used by CMA-CGM, along with the corresponding global port code (when applicable), the name of the port, and its geographical location (latitude and longitude).

How to Use
Clone this repository or download the JSON file directly.
Include the JSON file in your project.
Parse the JSON data according to your project's requirements.
Use the port codes data as needed in your applications or analyses.
